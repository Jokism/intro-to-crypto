      <h2>Course Goal</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to provide you (the student) with a working understanding of
        cryptographic primitives and the confidence to pursue further study or
        real world application of your knowledge (including, but not limited to,
        boring your loved ones with enthusiastic descriptions of obscure
        cryptographic constructions over the dinner table).
      </p>

          <a href="http://toc.cryptobook.us/">Text Book</a>: this is written by
          Dan Boneh at Stanford. We will not be following it too closely, but it
          is an excellen resource for reading and learning more about
          cryptography.

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These policies are subject to change at my discretion as the
          instructor. However, I will announce all changes and will do my best
          to avoid making significant changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Course Contract: I, as the instructor, agree to provide you with the
          resources you need to succeed in this class and you as the student
          will do your best to succeed. By offering this class, I agree to this
          contract and by taking the class you agree to this contract and agree
          to adhere to all course policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Course Honor Code:
          <i>I will not lie, cheat, or steal</i>. I understand that, at times,
          this class may feel stressful. If you are feeling overwhelmed and
          concerned about your ability to achieve the grade you are aiming for
          in this class, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly and
          we can work out a plan together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Course Errors:</i>
          If you find a mistake in any course materials (including this site,
          lectures, or assigned homework), I will give you up to a 5% bump on an
          assignment of your choice. This is a first come first serve policy
          (i.e. only the first student to spot and report a error will receive
          the credit). I will award an extra 2% to any student who makes a PR
          with the fix that is successfully merged into the class.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Office Hours:</i>
          Because of my schedule, I will not be able to hold weekly office hours
          at a regularly scheduled time. If you would like to speak with me
          directly, please reach out over email and we will find a time that
          works for both of us. I am hoping to meet all of you over the course
          of the semester so I can learn more about the experiences you bring to
          this course and what you are hoping to get out of it. To incentivize
          this, I will give anyone who meets with me during office hours, an
          additional 5/5 assignment points. You can also schedule office hours
          for any topic you wish, even beyond this class, including advice on
          working as a software/data engineer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Recording Lectures:</i>
          Please do not record my lectures. I understand during this zoom era
          that you may want to screen record the lectures. I hope you recognize
          that it is uncomfortable to be recorded on video. If you need an
          accommodation/exception to this policy, just let me know and we'll get
          that squared away.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Special Accommodation:</i>
          This class will be digital, but if you need any accommodations to make
          this course accessible, please do not hesitate to reach out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Homework/Grading Policies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Course Grade Structure:</i>
          There are two possible structures for your grade in this class and the
          choice is yours! Option 1: 100% of your grade is exclusively the sum
          of the total points you earn on homework assignments divided by the
          total number of possible points. Option 2: 75% of your grade is the
          sum of the total points you earn on homework assignments divided by
          the total possible points and the remaining 25% is your score on the
          optional final exam. I am building in this flexibility so that
          students who find the pressure of exams overwhelming do not need to
          put themselves through it and students who find homework annoying have
          another mechanism to demonstrate their knowledge!
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Late Homework:</i>
          You are allowed 5 late days throughout the semester. You can apply up
          to 3 late days to a given homework assignment. These late days cannot
          be split (i.e. 12 hours on one and 12 hours on another). If you are
          not able to submit an assignment on time, please speak with me
          directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Dropped Assignment:</i>
          You are allowed to drop a homework assignment of your choosing from
          your overall grade calculation. There may be an assignment that I do
          not allow any one to drop; I will make it clear when I assign an
          assignment that is "undroppable".
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Extra Credit:</i>
          Extra credit assignments. If you feel that your grade isn't as high as
          you are hoping it is and you want the opportunity to submit an extra
          credit assignment, please reach out to me directly. We will discuss
          which part of the class you find most interesting and design an
          assignment based on it. I will then make that extra credit assignment
          available to all of the students in the class.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Teaching Philosophy and Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        I have been lucky in that, thanks to several amazing teachers, I have
        felt comfortable in the classroom and was often that student raising
        their hand asking a million questions. When I transitioned to the
        teaching side of the classroom, I discovered that I loved answering
        those questions and soon became addicted to helping students. I hope to
        foster a community of learners in our digital classroom, where students
        feel comfortable asking quesitons, challenging me to offer a clearer
        explanation, and respecting one another. I don't believe in a heavy
        divide between teacher and student in the classroom. Rather, I see it as
        my responsibility to guide us through the content and I hope to empower
        each of you to take an active role in your education. I hope throughout
        this class you take time to stop and deeply explore ideas you find
        interesting and compelling. If you are interested in some of the
        pedagogy behind the classroom, check out
        <i>Teaching to Transgress</i> by bell hooks.
